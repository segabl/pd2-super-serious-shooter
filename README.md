# Super Serious Shooter

A mod that turns the game into a (mediocre) tactical shooter.

While it is not a requirement, it is highly recommended to use [Streamlined Heisting](https://github.com/segabl/pd2-streamlined-heisting) in combination with this.
You may try and use another mod that improves enemy AI (such as REAI, LIES or FSS) which should work fine aswell but the mod is mainly tested with Streamlined Heisting.

This mod doesn't touch your save file, skills or inventory.
