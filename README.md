# Super Serious Shooter

A mod that turns the game into a (mediocre) tactical shooter.

While it is not a requirement, it is highly recommended to use [Streamlined Heisting](https://github.com/segabl/pd2-streamlined-heisting) in combination with this.
You may try and use any other mod that improves enemy AI and it should work just fine but the mod is mostly made with Streamlined Heisting in mind.
